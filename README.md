# on-line-scientifica
This program is transmitting DATA through simulate RS-232 by USB port to a scientifica micromanipulator controller unit, 
and I'm planning to upgrade it to an online line monitoring system.
The transmitting data formats are regulated by Scientifica PSC-6400 API. 
Therefore, I've done the packages of data pack in command.cpp.
Second, the movements of micromanipulator are composited by a series of command. I've made some default movement in operation.cpp
Last, I'll summaries the movement in main.cpp to output the program.
